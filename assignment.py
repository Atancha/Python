# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)
w = 78
h = 1.75
i = h ** 2
BMI = (w/i)
print(BMI)


# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
l = 48
w = 25
p = 2 *(l+w)
print(p)
a = (l * w)
print(a)
